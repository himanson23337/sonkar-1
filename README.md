A To-Do List Application is a simple yet powerful Python project designed to help users manage and organize their daily tasks efficiently. The application provides an easy-to-use interface, where users can create, update, and track their to-do lists, ensuring they stay productive and on schedule.
This project can be built in two ways:

Command-Line Interface (CLI): A beginner-friendly version where tasks are managed through text-based input and output. Users can add tasks, mark them as completed, delete them, and view pending or completed tasks. Data is stored in a JSON or text file for persistence, so tasks remain available even after closing the program.

Graphical User Interface (GUI): An advanced version developed using Tkinter or PyQt. The GUI provides buttons and menus for easier task management. Tasks are displayed in a list, with features to edit, update, and delete them. Optionally, tasks can be stored in a SQLite database for more reliable data handling.
